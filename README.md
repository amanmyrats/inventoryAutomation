Automated way of creating room inventory documentations.

Innovative way of doing inventory:

Instead of preparing 900 files, only one file as a database needed to be prepared.
All departments work only on one file. This fileâ€™s size never exceeds 3-5 mb.
All data entered is stored as text: instead of picture itself, database contains picture names only. Pictures are stored in pc itself rather than in excel.
After all, application prepares inventory automatically for each of those 900 documents separately and stores in pc.
Printing is easy with this App. App will give you just one PDF file to print and the rest will be printer's job. This PDF includes all needed rooms' inventories. Since app is flexible, employee can print only specific level, only specific room, only specific block or whole project at once.
